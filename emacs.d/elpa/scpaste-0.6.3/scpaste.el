;;; scpaste.el --- Paste to the web via scp.

;; Copyright © 2008-2012 Phil Hagelberg

;; Author: Phil Hagelberg
;; URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/SCPaste
;; Version: 0.6.3
;; Created: 2008-04-02
;; Keywords: convenience hypermedia
;; EmacsWiki: SCPaste
;; Package-Requires: ((htmlize "1.39"))

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This will place an HTML copy of a buffer on the web on a server
;; that the user has shell access on.

;; It's similar in purpose to services such as http://paste.lisp.org
;; or http://rafb.net, but it's much simpler since it assumes the user
;; has an account on a publicly-accessible HTTP server. It uses `scp'
;; as its transport and uses Emacs' font-lock as its syntax
;; highlighter instead of relying on a third-party syntax highlighter
;; for which individual language support must be added one-by-one.

;;; Install

;; Add Marmalade as a package source, and then run M-x package-install
;; scpaste.

;; Set `scpaste-http-destination' and `scpaste-scp-destination' to
;; appropriate values, and add this to your Emacs config:

;; (setq scpaste-http-destination "http://p.hagelb.org"
;;       scpaste-scp-destination "p.hagelb.org:p.hagelb.org")

;; If you have a different keyfile, you can set that, too:
;; (setq scpaste-scp-pubkey "~/.ssh/my_keyfile.pub")

;; Optionally you can set the displayed name for the footer and where
;; it should link to:
;; (setq scpaste-user-name "Technomancy"
;;       scpaste-user-address "http://technomancy.us/")

;;; Usage

;; M-x scpaste, enter a name, and press return. The name will be
;; incorporated into the URL by escaping it and adding it to the end
;; of `scpaste-http-destination'. The URL for the pasted file will be
;; pushed onto the kill ring.

;; You can autogenerate a splash page that gets uploaded as index.html
;; in `scpaste-http-destination' by invoking M-x scpaste-index. This
;; will upload an explanation as well as a listing of existing
;; pastes. If a paste's filename includes "private" it will be skipped.

;; You probably want to set up SSH keys for your destination to avoid
;; having to enter your password once for each paste. Also be sure the
;; key of the host referenced in `scpaste-scp-destination' is in your
;; known hosts file--scpaste will not prompt you to add it but will
;; simply hang.
